# Open-Source-Tools-Used

- eSim 
    - eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.
    - https://esim.fossee.in/home

- Ngspice
    - ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.
    - http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/

- SkyWater Open Source PDK
    - The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.
    - https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk

- Magic
    - Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology.

    ```
    $ ./configure --enable-sky130-pdk

    $ make

    $ sudo make install
    ```

## Magic Installation
In terminal, execute the following commands

- To download the repository into the current working directory
    ```
    $ git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/magic
    ```

- Go to `magic` directory

    ```
    $ cd magic
    ```

- Configure and install
    ```
    $ sudo ./configure

    $ sudo make

    $ sudo make install
    ```
# Clone This Project
To Clone this repository, execute the following from terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rohinthram/avsd_opamp
```
Or download and extract the files

# Pre Layout Schematic and Simulations
- Go to the directory  `pre_layout/pre_layout_simulation` 
    ```
    $ cd pre_layout/pre_layout_simulation
    ```
- Execute each and every `.cir` using `ngspice` command from terminal
    ```
    $ ngspice <file-name>
    ```
    - Replace `<file-name>` with file name of the analysis required
- The necessary plot is obtained upon successful execution of the file

## Differential Mode Gain

```
$ ngspice differential_gain.cir
```

![Differential Gain Magnitude in dB](pre_layout/pre_layout_plots/differential_gain_mag.png)

![Differential Gain Phase in degrees](pre_layout/pre_layout_plots/differential_gain_phase.png)

## Common Mode Gain
```
$ ngspice common_mode_gain.cir
```

![Common Gain Magnitude in dB](pre_layout/pre_layout_plots/common_mode_gain.png)

## Offset Voltage
```
$ ngspice offset_voltage.cir
```

![Offset Voltage](pre_layout/pre_layout_plots/offset_voltage.png)

## Input Noise Spectrum

```
$ ngspice input_noise_spectrum.cir
```	
For obtaining Noise Spectrum 
- Please run the following commands in the ngspice window for obtaining the plot


- Use `setplot` to see all plots available

    ```
    ngspice-> setplot
    ```

- select the plot which has "Noise Spectral Density Curves".For example,
    ```
    ngspice-> setplot noise1
    ```
- Then plot the graph using the command
    ```
    ngspice-> plot inoise_spectrum
    ```

## Power Dissipation
```
$ ngspice power_dissipation.cir
```

## Slew Rate
```
$ ngspice slew_rate.cir
```

![Slew Rate](pre_layout/pre_layout_plots/slew_rate.png)

A much easier plot to see slew rate could be obtained by chaning the analysis as
```
.tran 0.01u 2u
```

Or execute the following command in the terminal
```
cp avsd_opamp/skywater_pdk/sky130A.tech <target-destination>

    - Extract the **.mag** file using (from tkcon terminal)(magic terminal)
        ```
        % extract all
        ```
    - Convert **.ext** to **.spice** using
        ```
        % ext2spice
